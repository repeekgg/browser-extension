# Repeek (formerly FACEIT Enhancer)

> Browser extension that enhances the FACEIT experience and adds useful features

Originally created to replace the FACEIT HELPER browser extension, that got broken after FACEIT updated their website and FACEIT HELPER wasn't maintained anymore, Repeek became a must-have browser extension with over 700.000 users and growing for FACEIT users.

The goal of Repeek is to make everyone's life easier with automatation and showing additional information that normally only 3rd party websites are exposing from the FACEIT API, but these websites are usually full of ads and other shady stuff to make a profit out of it.

After releasing Repeek, I got approached by FACEIT and was asked to join them. Ultimately this project landed me a job at FACEIT in June 2018, which wasn't my plan at all actually. I've left FACEIT in September 2021.
